## TTD_DE_UC01_EDA: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on provided CSV data

### Summary
This assessments evaluates the capabilities of the candidate in solving data engineering use cases. 
The candidate is required to solve the below assessment questions using a Jupyter notebook and post the solutions in the notebook in the assessment section.
Each assessment is structured as a collection of one or more scenarios that need to be addressed by the data engineer.

### Problem Statement

Business users have asked the data engineers to assist with exploratory data analysis to enable business make informed decisions.
Business would like to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset as part of reporting and also to prepare data for Machine Learning purposes.
The business user has recently joined the organization and is unfamiliar with the data and has asked the data engineer to just assist with the review of the data so that they generate reports together.
The business user would first like to explore the data and see if there are any patterns in the data that can be used for reporting.

### Detailed Instructions

* Detailed instructions for the submission are available in the attached notebook [EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/bmwttd/TTD_DE_UC01_EDA/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
